I have been using Keepass (KeepassX) for a while now (replacing Password Safe). It works well and does everything I need. There is even an Android app (KeePassDroid), along with ports for other platforms <http://keepass.info/download.html>.

Storing files on Dropbox, means they are always available on any computers that are linked to your Dropbox account. Dropbox also now has an Android client so you can view files on your phone.

Now to have your password file available you could just pop the file within your Dropbox folder, however for extra security you can create a key file for the password database. This then means that to open the password database you need not just the password but the key file also.

A good secure option then would be to store your password database in Dropbox and your key file on the computers or devices that need it.

For your password itself be sure to set a secure one of at least 8 mixed case alpha numeric characters.
