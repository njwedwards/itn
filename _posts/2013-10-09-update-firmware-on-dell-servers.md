We run Linux a lot on Dell servers but also now Omnios (Solaris). Had an issue on a server and wanted to update the firmware. There did not appear to be an easy way to do this when not running (Linux/Windows).

What I did find was that there is a Dell (unoffical) Centos LiveCD, containing the latest firmware (related to Poweredge servers I think), that can be booted and will give you the option to update the firmware easily.

Refer to following pages for more info:

http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/b/techcenter/archive/2012/09/06/centos-based-firmware-livedvd-with-om-7-1.aspx

Or you can just download the latest iso [here][1]

The LiveCD does take quite a while to boot, but once it has it will display a windows showing you what firmware updates can be made.

UPDATE:

In order to update the BMC controller on an old PE SC1425 I had to use the Centos 5.6 i386 livecd and ensure that I installed &#8216;compat-libstdc++-33.i386&#8242;.Â Before doing this I had tried to install the .BIN file in other version of Centos and Ubuntu but could not get it to work.
